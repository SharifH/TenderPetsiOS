    <p>TenderPets is an app that allows it's users to search through a vast selection of animals of all kinds. The purpose of our app is to have users see these animals and fall in love, as all these animals are up for adoption. We allow the users to search based on a specific species and breed or we have a randomizing fuction that will randomly select pets that are available for adoption from a variety of species within your search radius.</p>
    <p>All of these animals are located at shelters or are affiliated with shelters none of the animals will be from a breeder.</p>
    <p>This app was created by two avid animal lovers hoping to help solve a problem that exists and if we even make a small amount of change to some of these animals lives we feel that this will have been a success. TenderPets is a non-profit and takes no money from anyone advertisers/shelters included.</p>
